Thanks to me, thousands of people have stopped exhausting themselves with diets and have learned to eat properly, relying on their internal indicators and tests. I am against restrictions and diets. I support mindful eating and adequate physical activity. Food is our fuel. My mission is to teach you how to nourish yourself properly.",
